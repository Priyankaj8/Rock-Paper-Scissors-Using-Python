# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

A simple console-based **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game implemented in Python, where the player competes against the computer.

## Features
- Randomized computer choice for fair gameplay.
- Simple win/loss logic based on traditional Rock-Paper-Scissors rules.
- Interactive console-based experience.

## How It Works
1. The player selects their choice:  
   - `'r'` for Rock  
   - `'p'` for Paper  
   - `'s'` for Scissors  
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3. The winner is determined based on the rules:  
   - **Rock beats Scissors**  
   - **Scissors beats Paper**  
   - **Paper beats Rock**  
4. The game announces the result: *Win*, *Lose*, or *Tie*.
